* # 703 Resistance Radio:
  At this time, we have received reports, as yet unconfirmed, of increased radiation readings and "industrial noises" coming from the Oblate Temple on old Duke St. The Tsar of the New Dominion has declared a 2km perimeter of restricted area around the ruins. WHAT are THEY hiding?!

)

Yield = 2 round, 12"/30cm pizzas

* # Provender:
1. 1.25 cups warm water

2. 1 cup fed/ripe sourdough starter (50% hydration)

3. 2.25 cups UNBLEACHED all purpose flour

4. 1 tbsp olive oil

5. 1 tsp salt

6. If you want to expedite the rising process, add 1/2 tablespoon of yeast. Omit for pure sourdough flavor.

* # Method:
1. Mix everything above (except salt) in a nonreactive bowl and let rest, uncovered for 10 mins.
2. Now add salt and mix again.
3. Turn the very wet/sticky dough onto a heavily floured surface.
4. Knead for 2 minutes at most. Dough should remain soft and with just a light springyness
5. Place in a covered bowl and let rise for as long as it takes for it to double in size if using same day. For best results, let it rise/ferment for 12-72 hours in the fridge (in a ziplock bag, remove from fridge once a day to work dough briefly by pressing/squeezing the bag for 2 mins).
