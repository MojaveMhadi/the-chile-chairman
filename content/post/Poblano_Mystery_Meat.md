# Provender:
1. 2lbs / 1kg ground beef (80/20)
2. 1 medium size sweet onion (finely chopped)
3. 1 small carrot (finely chopped)
4. 1 celery stalk (finely chopped)
5. 2 cups / 473ml tomato sauce (use canned, peeled tomatoes reduced to this volume)
6. 32oz / 950ml beef or chicken stock. Use homemade stock if at all possible.
7. 1 poblano chile (skin charred/removed) diced
8. Salt to taste

# Method:
1. In a large skillet cook onions until translucent over medium heat.

2. Once onions are translucent, add carrot and celery and cook until softened.

3. Remove onion, carrot, and celery from the skillet and turn the heat to high.

4. Brown beef in 2 batches to prevent the pan temperature from dropping too low.

5. Once the beef is browned, add all beef, carrot, celery, onions, diced poblano chile and tomato sauce to the pan, stirring for 1 minute.

6. Add the stock, bring to a boil for 1 minute then reduce the heat to a low simmer and leave it uncovered and allow it to reduce to desired thickness, stirring occasionally. This must simmer a minimum of 3 hours, but 4-8 is better.

7. Consume.
