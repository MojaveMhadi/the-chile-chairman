# Vaguely Mexican Rice


# Provender: 

1. 1 cup jasmine rice

2. 2 cups chicken stock (homemade if possible)

3. 1.5 cups of the best canned peeled tomatoes (with juice) you can muster (in season go with fresh, cooked down to equivalent volume)

4. 1 jalapeño (or green pepper) deseeded and diced

5. 1/4 white onion diced

6. 2 cloves garlic minced

7. 1/2 tablespoon cumin powder

8. Salt to taste

9. Finely chopped cilantro for garnish

10. Wide skillet/pan with lid. Optimal is a 12” (30cm) or larger cast iron skillet.

# Method:

1. Heat skillet over medium heat for 20 minutes.

2. In a separate pot, combine the tomato and stock and bring to a boil, then reduce heat to lowest setting.

3. Add small amount of sesame oil or clarified butter to pan and then add rice, salt, and cumin (DO NOT RINSE RICE!!!)

4. Stir slowly but continuously for 3-5 minutes (or whenever rice begins to take on a golden color.

5. Add onion, garlic, and jalapeño and continue stirring another 2 minutes.

6. Add the stock plus tomato all at once, being careful not to get steam burns from the vaporization.

7. Put the lid on the pot immediately.

8. Turn the heat to low and maintain a simmer with the lid on for 20-25 min (when all the water is absorbed) *I find the ideal way is to cut the heat at 20 minutes and let the residual heat in the cast iron pan handle the last 5 mins. This greatly reduces the chance of burning the bottom layer of rice.*

9. Stir around with a fork adding the cilantro then eat once you have fulfilled the daily work quota.
