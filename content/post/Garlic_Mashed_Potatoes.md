# Provender:

1. 5lbs / 2.2 kg gold potatoes (SKIN ON! SKIN ON! SKIN ON! SKIN ON!)
2. 8oz / 225g of the best salted butter you can get
3. 4oz / 117 ml heavy cream
4. Salt to taste
5. 4 cloves garlic minced

# Method:

1. In a pot, melt butter over low temperature. Do not let it brown.

2. Boil potatoes in lightly salted water until they are pierced easily by/slide off of a fork.

3. When the butter is melted, add the garlic and adjust the heat as needed until the garlic begins to lightly fry. Allow the garlic to fry until very fragrant (do not let the garlic brown) and remove from heat and leave in the butter.

4. Drain water from the potato pot and start mashin, adding salt as you go.

5. Add all the butter/garlic and continue mashing.

6. Once butter has been absorbed into the potatoes, add cream in increments to desired texture. Less/none will yield thicker mash, the full 4oz / 117 ml will give creamier mash.

7. Consume.
