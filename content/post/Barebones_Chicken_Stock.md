# Barebones Chicken Stock

# Provender:

1. 1 chicken corpse + as many additional chicken bones as desired

2. Salt

3. Water to cover

4. 6 unpeeled garlic cloves

5. 1/2 onion (skin on)

# Method:

1. Place corpse in a large pot. For the bones, place in a single layer on a baking sheet and bake at 450F for 25 mins/until they start turning golden brown (this vastly improves stock flavors and color).

2. Lay bones in with corpse and garlic/onion if using. Cover with enough cool water to cover and add salt until it has just a slight hint of saltiness. Be careful not to turn it into a brine, as the water will reduce by 50% and the saltiness will overpower the meat flavor.

3. Bring to a slight boil, then immediately turn the heat to a very low simmer (steam should come off visibly but with no rapid bubbling) and let it go for 12 hours/overnight. When it is reduced by 50% and has a distinct meaty flavor it is done. For even stronger flavor, reduce out another 10%.
