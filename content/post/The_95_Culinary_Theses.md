**The Ninety-Five Culinary Theses**

1.Those persons ordering any steak "well done" shall be brought before the local party apparatus to effect self criticism and to renounce any other heretical, and or counterrevolutionary, practices. The need of further disciplinary actions shall be decided by the local party committee.

2.Those commercial ventures (with or without party endorsement in general) serving pineapple on pizza shall be designated "enemies of the people". Following appearance at the nearest struggle session, their assets are forfeit, their party membership revoked.

3.The fulfillment of chipotle production quotas takes the highest priority in the execution of the five year plan. The chile is the foundation of party solidarity against the "natural flavor added" of agricultural robber barrons, grain hoarders, capitalist roaders, fusion trend speculators and their vassal bodies in Sacramento.

4.Possession, distribution, or consumption of imitation crab meat shall result in culinary reeducation, for a term of no less than 2 years.

5.The party's interpretation of politically reliable cuisine is the only correct interpretation.

6.It shall be explicitly forbidden to add lettuce, shredded yellow cheese, or sour cream to any foodstuff labled "taco". 

7.Those who ignore the party interpretations concerning the minimum level of chile in Mojavistani regionally protected dishes shall be sentenced to a 10 year term of hard labor in Death Valley.

8.The addition of ketchup to eggs shall be considered both heretical and an act of instigation against the unity of the peoples' cuisine.

9.It is the duty of every Mojavistani to engage in culinary self criticism and the criticism of reactionary tendencies anywhere they appear.

10.It shall be a capital offense to add tomato to guacamole, as shall it be to aid and abet those who perpetuate this reactionary practice.
